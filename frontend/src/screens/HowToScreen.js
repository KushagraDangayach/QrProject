//       <h1 className="title-how-to">How to Wear Clothes</h1>
//       <p>
//         Wearing clothes is an important part of daily life, and it can be a lot
//         of fun too! Here are some tips and ideas for how to wear clothes:
//       </p>
//       <div className="how-to-methods">
//         <h2 className="how-to-title">1. Start with the Basics</h2>
//         <p>
//           When putting together an outfit, it's important to start with the
//           basics. This includes things like a plain t-shirt, a pair of jeans, or
//           a simple dress. Once you have the basics in place, you can start to
//           add in more interesting pieces.
//         </p>
//         <h2 className="how-to-title">2. Mix and Match</h2>
//         <p>
//           Don't be afraid to mix and match different patterns and textures. For
//           example, you could wear a striped shirt with a floral skirt, or a
//           leather jacket with a silk blouse. Just make sure that the colors and
//           patterns complement each other.
//         </p>
//         <h2 className="how-to-title">3. Accessorize</h2>
//         <p>
//           Accessories can really make an outfit pop. Try adding a scarf, a
//           statement necklace, or a fun pair of earrings to your outfit. Just
//           make sure not to overdo it, and keep the rest of your outfit
//           relatively simple.
//         </p>
//         <h2 className="how-to-title">4. Layer Up</h2>
//         <p>
//           Layering is a great way to add interest to an outfit. Try layering a
//           sweater over a collared shirt, or wearing a denim jacket over a dress.
//           This can also be practical in colder weather.
//         </p>
//         <h2 className="how-to-title">5. Be Confident</h2>
//         <p>
//           At the end of the day, the most important thing is to be confident in
//           what you're wearing. Wear clothes that make you feel good, and don't
//           worry too much about what other people might think. If you feel good,
//           you'll look good too!
//         </p>
